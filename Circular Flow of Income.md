## Meaning

The _circular flow of income_ refers to the continuous movement of money, goods, and services between different sectors of the economy, illustrating how income flows from producers to households and back again in a loop.

---

## Two-Sector Economy

### Assumptions

1. Only two sectors: **Households** and **Firms**.
2. Households own all factors of production (labor, capital, land).
3. Firms produce goods and services using these factors.
4. No government intervention or foreign trade.
5. All income is spent; no savings.

### Process

- **Real Flow**:
  - Households provide factor services to firms.
  - Firms produce goods and services consumed by households.

- **Money Flow**:
  - Firms pay factor payments (wages, rent, interest, profits) to households.
  - Households use this income to purchase goods and services from firms.

---

## Circular Flow with Savings and Investments

- **Savings (S)**:
  - Represent _leakages_ from the circular flow.
  - Occur when households do not spend all their income.

- **Investments (I)**:
  - Represent _injections_ into the circular flow.
  - Firms borrow savings to invest in capital goods.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S = I
$$

- Equilibrium is maintained when total leakages equal total injections.

---

## Three-Sector Economy (Government Included)

- **Leakages**:
  - **Savings (S)**
  - **Taxes (T)**: Money paid by households and firms to the government.

- **Injections**:
  - **Investments (I)**
  - **Government Expenditure (G)**: Spending on goods, services, and transfer payments.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S + T = I + G
$$

---

## Four-Sector Economy (Including Foreign Sector)

- **Leakages**:
  - **Savings (S)**
  - **Taxes (T)**
  - **Imports (M)**: Money spent on foreign goods and services.

- **Injections**:
  - **Investments (I)**
  - **Government Expenditure (G)**
  - **Exports (X)**: Revenue from selling goods and services abroad.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S + T + M = I + G + X
$$

## Importance of Circular Flow

1. **Economic Interdependence**: Highlights how sectors rely on each other.
2. **National Income Estimation**: Assists in calculating GDP and understanding income distribution.
3. **Identifying Leakages and Injections**: Helps policymakers manage economic stability.
4. **Understanding Economic Fluctuations**: Provides insight into how disturbances can affect the entire economy.
