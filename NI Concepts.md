## Key Concepts

### 1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)

- **Definition**: Total market value of all final goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period.
- **Includes**:
  - Consumer expenditure (_C_).
  - Investment (_I_).
  - Government spending (_G_).
  - Net exports (_X - M_).
- **Formula**:
  $$
  GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Measures domestic production.
  - Indicator of economic health.

### 2. Gross National Product (GNP)

- **Definition**: GDP plus net factor income from abroad (income earned by residents from overseas investments minus income earned within the domestic economy by foreign residents).
- **Formula**:
  $$
  GNP = GDP + \text{Net Factor Income from Abroad (NFIA)}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Reflects the income of a country's residents.

### 3. Net Domestic Product (NDP)

- **Definition**: GDP minus depreciation (also known as capital consumption allowance).
- **Formula**:
  $$
  NDP = GDP - \text{Depreciation}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Accounts for wear and tear on capital goods.

### 4. Net National Product (NNP)

- **Definition**: GNP minus depreciation.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  NNP = GNP - \text{Depreciation}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Represents net value of goods and services produced.

### 5. National Income (NI)

- **Definition**: Total income earned by a nation's residents in the production of goods and services.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  NI = NNP - \text{Indirect Taxes} + \text{Subsidies}
  $$
- **Alternative Calculation**:
  $$
  NI = \text{Compensation of Employees} + \text{Rent} + \text{Interest} + \text{Profits} + \text{Mixed Income}
  $$

### 6. Personal Income (PI)

- **Definition**: Income received by individuals and households before personal taxes.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  PI = NI - \text{Corporate Taxes} - \text{Retained Earnings} + \text{Transfer Payments}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Transfer payments include pensions, unemployment benefits.

### 7. Disposable Income (DI)

- **Definition**: Income available to individuals after paying personal taxes.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  DI = PI - \text{Personal Taxes}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Represents income available for spending and saving.

### 8. Per Capita Income (PCI)

- **Definition**: Average income per person.
- **Formula**:
  $$
  PCI = \frac{NI}{\text{Population}}
  $$
- **Notes**:
  - Indicator of the standard of living.

## Applications of National Income Concepts

- **Economic Planning**: Assists governments in policymaking and resource allocation.
- **International Comparisons**: Enables comparison of economic performance between countries.

- **Fiscal and Monetary Policies**: Guides central banks and governments.

## Limitations of National Income Accounting

- **Non-Market Transactions**: Excludes household work, volunteer services.
- **Income Distribution**: Doesn't reflect income inequalities.
- **Quality of Goods**: Doesn't account for improvements in product quality.
- **Environmental Factors**: Ignores environmental degradation and resource depletion.
- **Underground Economy**: Omits illegal activities and unreported income.

## Additional Notes

- **Adjustments**:
  - **Real vs. Nominal Values**: Adjust for inflation using price indices.
  - **Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)**: Adjusts for price level differences across countries.
- **Green GDP**: Adjusted GDP accounting for environmental costs.
- **Human Development Index (HDI)**: Considers life expectancy, education, and per capita income.
