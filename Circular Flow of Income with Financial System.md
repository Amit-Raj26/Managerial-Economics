## Two-Sector Economy with Financial System

- **Introduction**:
  - Incorporates financial markets into the basic two-sector model.
  
- **Process**:
  - **Savings (S)**:
    - Households save part of their income.
    - Savings are a _leakage_ from the circular flow.
  
  - **Investments (I)**:
    - Firms borrow savings for investment purposes.
    - Investments are an _injection_ into the circular flow.

- **Role of Financial Institutions**:
  - Act as intermediaries between savers and investors.
  - Facilitate the flow of funds in the economy.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S = I
$$

## Three-Sector Economy

- **Inclusion of Government Sector**:
  - **Taxes (T)**: Leakages.
  - **Government Expenditure (G)**: Injections.
  
- **Process**:
  - Government collects taxes from households and firms.
  - Spends on public services, infrastructure, and transfers.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S + T = I + G
$$

## Four-Sector Economy

- **Inclusion of Foreign Sector**:
  - **Imports (M)**: Leakages.
  - **Exports (X)**: Injections.

- **Process**:
  - Domestic economy engages in trade with the rest of the world.
  - Net exports (X - M) affect the national income.

### Equilibrium Condition

$$
S + T + M = I + G + X
$$

---

## Conclusion

1. **Total Leakages**: Savings (S), Taxes (T), Imports (M).
2. **Total Injections**: Investments (I), Government Expenditure (G), Exports (X).
3. **Equilibrium**: Economy is in equilibrium when total leakages equal total injections.
