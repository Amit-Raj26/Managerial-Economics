## Market Structures

### Perfect Competition

- **Definition**: Market structure with many buyers and sellers trading identical products.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Firms are price takers.
  - Free entry and exit.
  - Perfect information.
  - Homogeneous products.
- **Equilibrium**:
  - **Short-Run**: Firms can make supernormal profits or losses.
  - **Long-Run**: Firms make normal profits due to entry and exit.
  - **Condition**: \( P = MC = MR \)

### Monopoly Market

- **Definition**: Single seller with no close substitutes.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Price maker.
  - High barriers to entry (legal, natural, strategic).
  - Unique product.
- **Equilibrium**:
  - Profit maximization where \( MR = MC \).
  - Can sustain long-term supernormal profits.
- **Price Discrimination**:
  - Charging different prices to different consumers.
- **Regulation**:
  - Government intervention to control monopoly power.

### Monopolistic Competition

- **Definition**: Market structure with many sellers offering differentiated products.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Product differentiation.
  - Some control over pricing.
  - Free entry and exit in the long run.
- **Equilibrium**:
  - Firms earn normal profits in the long run.
  - Excess capacity due to downward-sloping demand curve.

### Oligopoly

- **Definition**: Market structure dominated by a few large firms.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Interdependence among firms.
  - Barriers to entry.
  - Non-price competition prevalent.
- **Models**:
  - **Cournot Model**: Firms choose quantities.
  - **Bertrand Model**: Firms compete on prices.
  - **Kinked Demand Curve**: Explains price rigidity.

---

## Shutdown Point

- **Definition**: Level of operation where the firm covers its variable costs but not fixed costs.
- **Calculation**:
  - Occurs where price equals minimum Average Variable Cost (AVC).
- **Short-Run Decision**:
  - Continue operating if $P \geq AVC$.
- **Long-Run Decision**:
  - Exit the market if losses persist.

## Examples

1. **Perfect Competition Example**:
   - Firm with \( TC = 12 + 6Q + Q^2 \), Market Price \( P = 20 \).
   - **Marginal Cost (MC)**:
     $$
     MC = \frac{d(TC)}{dQ} = 6 + 2Q
     $$
   - **Equilibrium**:
     - Set \( P = MC \) to find profit-maximizing output:
       $$
       20 = 6 + 2Q \implies Q = 7
       $$
   - **Profit**:
     $$
     \text{Profit} = TR - TC = (P \times Q) - (12 + 6Q + Q^2)
     $$

2. **Monopoly Example**:
   - Demand: \( Q = 360 - 20P \) â‡’ \( P = 18 - 0.05Q \).
   - **Total Revenue (TR)**:
     $$
     TR = P \times Q = (18 - 0.05Q) \times Q = 18Q - 0.05Q^2
     $$
   - **Marginal Revenue (MR)**:
     $$
     MR = \frac{d(TR)}{dQ} = 18 - 0.1Q
     $$
   - **Marginal Cost (MC)**: Given or derived from cost function.
   - **Profit Maximization**:
     - Set \( MR = MC \) to find optimal \( Q \).

## Role of Demand Forecasting

- **Pricing Strategies**:
  - Forecast demand elasticity to set optimal prices.
- **Capacity Planning**:
  - Anticipate future demand to adjust production levels.
- **Market Analysis**:
  - Understand market trends, consumer preferences, and competitor actions.
- **Revenue Management**:
  - Adjust prices dynamically based on demand forecasts (e.g., airlines, hotels).

---

## Additional Notes

- **Price Discrimination**:
  - **First-Degree**: Charging maximum willingness to pay.
  - **Second-Degree**: Quantity discounts.
  - **Third-Degree**: Different prices in different markets.

- **Game Theory in Oligopoly**:
  - Strategic decision-making among competitors.
  - **Nash Equilibrium**: No player can benefit by unilaterally changing strategy.
  - **Prisoner's Dilemma**: Illustrates why firms might not cooperate.

- **Cost-Plus Pricing**:
  - Adding a standard markup to the cost of production.
  - Simple but may ignore market demand.

- **Kinked Demand Curve**:
  - Explains price rigidity in oligopoly.
  - Firms may not change prices due to potential reactions from competitors.
