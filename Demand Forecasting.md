## Meaning

Forecasting is the process of making predictions about the future based on past and present data. In business, **demand forecasting** estimates future demand for products or services, enabling firms to make informed decisions about production, inventory, staffing, and financial planning.

- **Long-Term Forecasting**:
  - Period: More than 1 year.
  - Focus: Strategic planning, capital investment, market expansion.

### 2. Information Basis

- **Passive Forecasting**:
  - Assumes continuation of existing trends without significant changes.
- **Active Forecasting**:

- **Trend Projection**:
  - Extending past trends into the future using time-series data.
  - Methods: Graphical method, least squares method.
- **Barometric Techniques**:
  - Using economic indicators (leading, coincident, lagging) to predict changes.
- **Regression Analysis**:
  - Establishing relationships between dependent and independent variables.
  - Multiple regression for more variables.
- **Econometric Models**:
  - Complex mathematical models representing economic processes.
  - Simultaneous equations to model interdependencies.

### 3. Other Methods

- **Market Experiments**:
  - Testing product demand in a controlled environment.
- **Historical Analogy**:
  - Comparing with similar products or markets.
- **Input-Output Analysis**:
  - Examines inter-industry relationships.
