## Meaning of Inflation

Inflation is a _persistent rise in the general price level_ of goods and services in an economy over a period of time, leading to a fall in the purchasing power of money.

- **Keynesian View**: Inflation starts when aggregate demand exceeds the economy's capacity to produce at full employment.
